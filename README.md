Quick-Test-CoffeeScript
=======================

Quickly test CoffeeScript and witness the javascript output


This is basically a more advanced version of the Try CoffeeScript editor on [coffeescript.org](http://coffeescript.org/#try)

This editor is more functional because it embeds compiled javascript directly into the page which allows window binding properties and DevTools console inspection.

The editor comes with a prebuilt `Say(object)` function that will print the `oject.toString()` to an output area on the webpage.
